{"task_id": "m2014_q6", "description": " This top Verilog module is a state machine that outputs a one-bit signal z. The module has four ports: a clock (clk), a reset (reset), an input (w), and an output (z). The module has six states, A to F. The next state of the state machine is determined by the current state and the input w. The transition from state A to state B is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state A to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state B to state C is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state C to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state C to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state D to state A is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state D to state F is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state E to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state E to state E is taken when the input w is low. The transition from state F to state D is taken when the input w is high. The transition from state F to state C is taken when the input w is low.  The state machine is triggered by the clk signal. When the clk signal is high, the state machine will check the reset signal. If the reset signal is high, the state machine will reset to state A, otherwise the state machine will transition to the next state.

{"task_id": "lemmings1", "description": " This top Verilog module is a state machine that controls the walking direction of a robot.

The areset port is an input port that is used to reset the state machine to the initial state. The bump_left and bump_right ports are input ports that indicate whether the robot has bumped into an obstacle on the left or right side. The walk_left and walk_right ports are output ports that indicate the walking direction of the robot.  The module has two parameters, WL and WR, which represent the two states of the state machine. The state machine is implemented using a register, state, and a combinational logic block. The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the bump_left and bump_right inputs. If the current state is WL, the next state will be WR if the bump_left input is high, and WL if the bump_left input is low. Similarly, if the current state is WR, the next state will be WL if the bump_right input is high, and WR if the bump_right input is low.

The combinational logic block is used to determine the next state of the state machine based on the current state and the input signal. The logic is as follows:   If the current state is A, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and A if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is B, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and C if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is C, then the next state will be D if the input signal is 1, and A if the input signal is 0.   If the current state is D, then the next state will be B if the input signal is 1, and C if the input signal is 0.   The state register is updated on the rising edge of the clock signal, clk, and is reset to state A on the rising edge of the reset signal, areset.
